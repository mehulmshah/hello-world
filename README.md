# hello-world
First repository to learn the basics of GitHub.
I'm a hardware engineer that's transitioning into software. I just graduated with my BS in EE from UCSD, and I'm currently working at Amazon Lab126. I'll be pursuing my MSEE at UCSD starting this fall, with a concentration in Machine Learning.
